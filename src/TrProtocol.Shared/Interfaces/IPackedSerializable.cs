    /// This guarantees that the struct's memory representation is contiguous and field order matches declaration order,

    ///   1. The struct has no implicit padding between fields
    ///   2. Auto and Sequential layouts produce identical memory layouts
    ///   3. The struct contains only unmanaged types

    /// When in doubt, explicitly apply [StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential, Pack = 1)] to the struct.
